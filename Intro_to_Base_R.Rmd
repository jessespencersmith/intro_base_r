We are interested in measuring the inflammation in a group of patients. 

## Load Data

```{r}
library(readr)
dat <- read_csv("data/inflammation-01.csv", 
    col_names = FALSE)
View(inflammation_01)
```

## Practice with Base R

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55
weight_kg
```

Find weight in pounds
```{r}
2.2 * weight_kg # I THINK 2.2 is the scale
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
weight_kg <- 100
```
```{r}
head(dat)
```
```{r}
class(dat)
```
```{r}
dim(dat)
```

I want to access the first day of the first patient's data.

row 1, column 1
```{r}
dat[1,1]
```
I want row 30, column 20
```{r}
dat[30, 20]
```




Combining numbers into a single object

I want rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 10, 20
```{r}
dat[c(1, 3, 5), c(10, 20)]
```

I want rows 1-10
```{r}
1:10
```


I wanted rows 1-10, and column 2
```{r}
dat[1:10, 2]
```
